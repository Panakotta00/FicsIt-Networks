= 8. Inter Computer Communication

As your software gets larger, you need to separate your network into multiple smaler ones.
The mod doesn't enforce this, but your computer will, as it will start to struggle
showing the component list in the component outliner and other stuff.
Since you still want to connect these separate networks somehow with each other,
you will need to use network routers in between.
Now the only way of communication is using network messages.

== Network Card
The network card is a PCI device you can build into your computer
and is its fully own network component, that means it also has its own UUID and Nick.
It will be connected to the same component network as your computer.
This also allows you to have multiple network cards if desired.

A network card can be used to send and receive network messages that are sent across the network.

To get a reference to your network card (or any other PCI device),
you can use the `computer.getPCIDevices(...)` function. +
It takes an Instance of a Class that represents the type of the PCI devices you want to get,
and returns an array of PCI devices that match the given class.

[source,lua]
local net = computer.getPCIDevices(findClass("NetworkCard"))[1]

[WARNING]
====
As mentioned, the network card has a different UUID than the Computer Case! +
This means if you want to address a network card to uni-cast send a message to it,
you have to use the network cards UUID, the computer case UUID won't work.
====

Before you can receive network messages,
you have to open the port of the network messages you want to receive.
You can do that by using the `open(port)` function of the network card:
[source,lua]
net:open(42) -- opens port 42 of the network card

You can close a port using the `close(port)` function:
[source,lua]
net:close(42)

If you want to close all open ports at once, you can use the `closeAll()` function:
[source,lua]
net:closeAll()

== Network Messages
A network messages is a payload message you can send from one network card to another. +
It contains the sender UUID, a Port Number, receiver UUID and up to 7 data parameters.

Messages can be grouped using Ports.
You can f.e. define that storage system messages are sent on port 1
and production management on port 2. +
They don't have a special meaning by FIN, they exist for your convenience.

You can send a message either to one specific network card,
or all network cards that are listening to the port of the message.

When receiving a network message, and you pull the signal,
you get following parameters:

1. signal/event name (every signal)
2. instance of signal sender (every signal) +
 In this case, the network card the received the message,
 especially useful when working with multiple network cards.
3. message sender +
 A string containing the UUID of the network message that sent the network message.
4. message port +
 A integer that defines the port on which this network message was sent.
5. Up to 7 additional data parameters that are sent as payload.

[source,lua]
local e, reveiver, sender, port, d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7 = event.pull()

Network messages can be sent in 2 different ways:

- send (uni-case) +
 Using the `send(...)` function of the network card, you can send a network message
 to one specific other network card. +
 If this receiving network card has the port, the message was sent on, not open,
 it will not receive the network message and nothing happens. +
 The `send(...)` function takes following parameters: +
 1. receiver +
  The UUID string of the network card you want to send the message too.
 2. port +
  The port on which you want to send the message as integer.
 3. Up to 7 data payload parameters of primitive type (number, string, boolean)
  that will be sent along in the network message.
[source,lua]
net:send("123", 42, "my", "data", 42, 56.9, true)

- broadcast (multi-cast/broadcast)
 Using the `broadcast(...)` function you can send a network message to all
 network cards that listen to the port you are sending the message to. +
 The `broadcase(...)` function takes following parameters:
 1. port +
  The port on which you want to send the message as integer.
 2. Up to 7 data payload parameters of primitive type that will be sent along
  in the network message.
[source,lua]
net:broadcast(43, "my", "broadcast", 69, false, "data")

[WARNING]
====
As mentioned, +
you can not send instances/references, structs, functions, arrays or tables via network  +
you would have to serialize tables etc. first to a string.
====

== Network Router
The network router building allows you to transfer network messages between
multiple separate component networks.

It has two component network connectors you can connect your networks. +
The router will have separate network components for each network.

It will redirect any network message by default, +
but you can also filter network messages if you want to.

In default configuration, you can simply send messages between the networks,
including broadcast messages.

There are two filters you can use, a port filter, and an address filter. +
You can interact with them separately. +
Each Filter can run in Whitelist or Blacklist mode.

If in whitelist mode, it only redirects network messages that match the filter. +
If in blacklist mode, it blocks network messages that match the filter.

A network message matches the port filter, if the port of the network message
is contained in the port list of the filter.

A network message matches the address filter, if the sender address
is contained in the address list of the filter.

If you want to learn more about how to setup the filters,
refer to the xref::Reflection.adoc#Class-NetworkRouter[reflection].

== Example
Computer A
[source,Lua]
----
local net = computer.getPCIDevices(findClass("NetworkCard"))[1]

event.ignoreAll()
event.listen(net)
net:open(42)

while true do
 local data = {event.pull()}
 e, s, sender, port, data = (function(e,s,sender,port,...)
  return e, s, sender, port, {...}
 end) (table.unpack(data))
 local d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7 = table.unpack(data)
 if e == "NetworkMessage" then
  if d1 == "ping" then
   net:send(sender, port, "pong")
  elseif d1 == "foo" then
   foo(data)
  end
 end
end

function foo(data)
 print(table.unpack(data))
end
----

[NOTE]
====
[source,lua]
e, s, sender, port, data = function(e,s,sender,port,...)
 return e, s, sender, port, {...}
end(table.unpack(data))

This code my seem a bit odd, but all it does is return the data from the `event.pull`
just normally as we are used to. +
But the additional parameters which we don't know how they could look like,
are packed into an array `data` for later use. +
For a general purpose event handler,
you can do this for everything besides signal name and signal sender.
====

Computer B
[source,lua]
----
local net = computer.getPCIDevices(findClass("NetworkCard"))[1]
net.send("123", 42, "ping")
net.send("123", 42, "foo", "meep", "muup", 69)
