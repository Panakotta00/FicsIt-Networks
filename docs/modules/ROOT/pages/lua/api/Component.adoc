= Component API
:description: The Component API helps to interact with the component network itself.

**Lua Lib: `component`**

The Component API provides structures, functions and signals for interacting with the network itself like returning network components.

== Functions

=== `Component | Component[] proxy(string ids... | string[] ids...)`

Generates and returns instances of the network components with the given UUIDs. +
You can pass any amount of parameters and each parameter will then have a corresponding return value. +
Each parameter can be either a string, or an array of strings.
These strings should then contain just the UUID of a network component. +
If a network component cannot be found for a given string, nil will be used for the return.
Otherwise, an instance of the network component will be returned. +
If a parameter is a string array, the return value will be an array of network component instances.

Parameter::
+
[cols="1,1,4a"]
