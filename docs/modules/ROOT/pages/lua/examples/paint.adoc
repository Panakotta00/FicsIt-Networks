= Paint Example

This small program uses a GPU and a Screen to make a small paint program ingame.

In the lower left corner you can choose between five different colors (clear, red, green, blue and white)
by simply clicking with your mouse onto one.

After that you can begin to draw on the screen with that selected color, by click and holding the mouse button
and then moving the mouse around. To stop drawing simply release the mouse button.

== Setup

You need small computer with a Lua CPU, a little bit RAM, a Screen Driver and GPU T1.
Then just plug in a Lua EEPROM and fill it with the code below.
Then just run it and switch to the computer screen and have some fun ^^

== Code

[source,Lua]
----
-- get first T1 GPU avialable from PCI-Interface
local gpu = computer.getPCIDevices(classes["GPUT1"])[1]
if not gpu then
 error("No GPU T1 found!")
end

-- get first Screen-Driver available from PCI-Interface
local screen = computer.getPCIDevices(classes["FINComputerScreen"])[1]
-- if no scren found, try to find large screen from component network
if not screen then
 local comp = component.findComponent(classes["Screen"])[1]
 if not comp then
  error("No Screen found!")
 end
 screen = component.proxy(comp)
end

-- setup gpu
event.listen(gpu)
gpu:bindScreen(screen)
w, h = gpu:getSize()

-- clear background
gpu:setBackground(0,0,0,0)
gpu:fill(0, 0, w, h, " ", " ")

-- setup color palette
colors = {{0,0,0,0},{0,0,0,0},{1,0,0,1},{1,0,0,1},{0,1,0,1},{0,1,0,1},{0,0,1,1},{0,0,1,1},{1,1,1,1},{1,1,1,1}}

-- draw color palette
for i, color in ipairs(colors) do
 gpu:setBackground(color[1], color[2], color[3], color[4])
 gpu:setText(i - 1, h - 1, " ")
end

gpu:setBackground(1,1,1,1)

-- draw loop
isDown = false
while true do
 e, s, x, y = event.pull()
 if e == "OnMouseDown" then
  isDown = true
  -- is press on color palette, select color
  if y == h - 1 and x < #colors then
   color = colors[x + 1]
   gpu:setBackground(color[1], color[2], color[3], color[4])
  end
 elseif e == "OnMouseUp" then
  isDown = false
 elseif e == "OnMouseMove" and not (y == h - 1 and x < #colors) and isDown then
  gpu:setText(x, y, " ")
 end
 gpu:flush()
end
