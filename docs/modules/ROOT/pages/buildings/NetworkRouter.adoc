The Network Router allows you to sepperate multiple component network from each other,
but shares network messages between those networks.

For that it has two network connectors.

You can also define filters to filter which messages are shared.
Each filter can be in Whitelist-Mode or Blacklist-Mode,
they are default set to Blacklist-Mode.
There is a Filter for allowed ports and for allowed sender addresses.
