The large screen allows you to place a screen with dynamic height and width
onto a foundation or wall.

You can also rotate it in any direction you want for even more customizeability.

You can connect the screen to a computer network and then use the reference
to the screen for the gpu's bind function so you can bind the screen with a gpu.

The maximum size of a screen is 10 x 10.
