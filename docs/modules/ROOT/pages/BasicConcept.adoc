= Basic Concept
:description: The basic concepts of FicsIt-Networks like network setup and interaction.

== Network Connector

A Network Connector is simply a point of a building were you can connect a network cable to and so, connect multiple different network components with eachother.

The Network Connector is also a Network Component itself.

== Network Component

A Network Component is anything that is connected to the network and can provide a interface for interactions to the network.

Network Components can be identified individually by their ID which is a guid (a implementation of UUID)

Example::
+
```
0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
```

Network Components can have a nick, which is a list of custom names seperated by spaces allowing you to group and name your network components.
Nick filters are then used to check if a network component has specific nicknames.

Example::
+
[source,Lua]
----
nick1 = "Test Power" -- nick1 with names "Test" and "Power"
nick2 = "Power" -- nick2 with name "Power"

filter1 = "Power" -- nick filter maches nick1 and nick2
filter2 = "Test" -- nick filter maches only nick1
filter3 = "Test Power" -- nick filter maches only nick1
filter4 = "Power Nice" -- nick filter maches noone
filter5 = "" -- nick filter maches every component (also components with no nick)
----

=== Lua

Every network component can be representated in lua as a table, the Lua-Component-Structure.
This Table contains some variables for identification of the structure itself and also the component.
But most important of all is, this table contains all functions provided by the component.

If the component disconnects from the network while the runtime contains a function value of this component the internal component pointer goes invalid, that means if you then try to execute the function, the Lua runtime will crash. If the component reconnects to the network, so does also the internal pointer come back valid so you can call it safely.

To get the Lua-Instance of a component you can use the `Component component.proxy(string)` function.

To learn more, visit the xref:lua/api/Component.adoc[Component API page].

=== Functions

Most network components provide simple functions for interacting with them via the network.
Each of these functions can have multiple input parameters which are all required. That also means that there is no function overloading or default values.
Also, quite interessting is, a function can have multiple output values which all will exist.

In this documentation we use **most of the time (not always)** this declaration scheme:

[source,Lua]
----
outType [outName], ... funcName([inType] inName, ...)
----

Examples:
[source,Lua]
----
int, string name test(rly, num howOften)
int getCount(string id)
string getName(id)
-- exceptions:
count getAmount(string)
----

==== Lua

To call such a function in Lua you simply need to get the Lua-Instance and call the member function in that table as method `:`.

If you want to get a list of all members of the Lua instnace's functions and attributes, you can use the `string[] getMembers()` function.

A simple usage of getMembers()
Example:
[source,Lua]
----
pole = component.proxy("76470BC3475F1B8A308A04BC557D6009") -- set network component with ID, use the ID for the machine you want
members = pole:getMembers() -- gets a table of usable functions and attributs for the machine
for _,m in pairs(members) do
 print(m) -- Prints the table
end
----

=== Signals

Signals are quite important because they allow us to listen for events happening in a network. That means we get notified when something happens and don't need to ask if there happend anything every tick.

When a signal occurs the signal gets added to the signalqueue of every computer subscribed to the object.
The signalqueue size depends on the configuration of the host.
If the queue is full, every further signal gets dropped until the queue has room for new signals.

If a computer wants to recieve the signals of a object, he needs to subscribe to the instance (listen to the instance). A computer can just subscribe once at a time to the same instance, but it can subscribe to multiple different ones at the same time.

==== Lua

If you want to listen to a instance you need to get the Lua-Instance and pass it to the `event.listen(Instance)` function.

To learn more, visit the xref:lua/api/Event.adoc#_listencomponent[Event API page].

For declarations in this documentation we use the same scheme as for functions.
