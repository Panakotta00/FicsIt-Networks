The network manager allows you to view detials of a network component.

When you take it in hands and look at a network component, you can left click to open the component debug window.
This window will show you the UUID of the component, allows you to change and view the nick,
view the connected network name and lists all connected computer network components.
You can also click on such a listed network component to copy the UUID of it.

When you hold ctrl, while looking at a network component and hit the left click,
the debug window wont appear but you will copy the ID of the component directly.

When you have the Manager in hand, you wont be able to interact with anything else except
network components, if you still want to do that,
you can use Caps-Lock to allow interaction with other things.
